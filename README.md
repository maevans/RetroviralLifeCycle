# Retroviral Life Cycle :microscope:
* The objective of this project is to display the **retroviral life cycle** as in appears in the human body. 
* `A retrovirus is a group of RNA viruses which insert a DNA copy of their genome into the host cell in order to replicate, e.g. HIV` 
* Retroviruses are unique in that they have the ability to conduct reverse transcriptase (the copying of RNA to DNA) and then splice the double stranded DNA into the host cell in order to replicate. The Nobel Prize Laureates in Medicine in 1975, Drs. Baltimore, Dulbecco, and Temin, were able to identify and showcase the enzyme that participates in the reverse transcriptase in a host cell. I will be showcasing this enzyme along with the entire life cycle of the virus.
